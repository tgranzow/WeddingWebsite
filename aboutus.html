                <h2> Where it all began</h2>
                <p>In February of 2015, Jason and I both decided to try online dating. Neither of us believed there was any chance it would work, and we both tried it with low expectations. And then through the magic of OKCupid, I received a message from
                    Jason. We had an instant connection. We made plans for a few weeks out, but less than a week later, we just had to see each other.
                </p>
                <p> On February 27, we met at the Marcus Majestic Movie Theater for our first date. We saw the movie Kingsman, a horrible movie, but the company was amazing. A week later, we had our second date, and from there, it was impossible to stop how
                    quickly we fell for each other. By September of 2015, our little family found and moved into our cozy home.

                    <h2>Our Engagement Story</h2>
                    <p>At the start of Semptember in 2016, Jason and Talia took a trip to Door County to celebrate Talia's birthday. They spent her birthday looking around Fish Creek and seeing all the little shops. The next morning, they got up early to
                        go explore Washington Island. For days, Jason had been asking Talia if she would be willing to climb to the top of the lookout tower with him. He emphasized how important it was to him. Talia, who has a large fear of heights, was
                        reluctant. She told him she would have to see once they got there. After a bit of a bumpy ferry ride, a slightly sea-sick Talia and a happy Jason reached the island and began exploring.
                    </p>
                    <p>They started off the morning stoping at a little pastry shop called the Danish Mill. After that, they began driving around searching for what to do next. After getting slightly lost, they passed the sign for the lookout tower. Much
                        to Jason's surprise, Talia suggested they should double back and go there first. Though it was sooner than Jason expected, he turned the car around and they traveled to the destination. Looking at the tower, Talia decided she wanted
                        to go up, and once they reached the top of the landing, the view was truly incredible. Jason and Talia were surrounded by the stunning views of the entire island.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a few minutes of taking pictures, Jason wrapped his arms around Talia and whispered, "Baby, we're on top of the world." Talia had no idea he was proposing until he finally turned her around to face him, and Jason got down on
                        one knee, asking Talia to marry him. With tears of joy in her eyes, she of course said, "YES!" Truly the perfect day to begin the next part of their journey.
